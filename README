sinit - suckless init
=====================

sinit is a simple init.  It was initially based on
Strake's init.c[1].

Why?
----

I wanted to get rid of Busybox init on my toy distro[2].

How?
----

sinit exposes a set of operations via a FIFO.  Normally
this FIFO resides at '/var/run/sinit.fifo'.  There are two
commands currently supported, 'reboot' and 'poweroff'.

To see how sinit integrates with the init scripts, then have
a look at [3].
